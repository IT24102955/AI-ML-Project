# Credit Card Approval Prediction AI Model - Project Overview

## Project Description
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict credit card application approvals using applicant demographic, financial, and employment information. The model will help financial institutions automate and streamline their credit assessment process while maintaining accuracy and fairness.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Credit card application data with 1,548 records
- **Features**: 17 applicant attributes including financial status, employment history, and demographic information
- **Target Variable**: Application approval status (Approved/Rejected)
- **Class Distribution**: 88.7% Approved vs 11.3% Rejected (imbalanced dataset)

## Team Responsibilities & Task Allocation

### **IT2412955 - Missing Data Handling**
**Responsibilities:**
- Identify and analyze missing values across all features
- Implement appropriate imputation strategies for different data types
- Handle missing values in critical features like Annual_income, Birthday_count, and Type_Occupation
- Ensure imputation methods maintain data integrity and distribution patterns

### **IT24104218 - Outlier Removal**
**Responsibilities:**
- Detect outliers in numerical features using statistical methods (IQR, Z-score)
- Analyze outlier impact on model performance
- Implement robust outlier treatment strategies
- Balance between outlier removal and data preservation

### **IT24101153 - Numerical Feature Scaling**
**Responsibilities:**
- Apply appropriate scaling techniques to numerical features
- Handle features with different scales and distributions
- Implement standardization/normalization methods
- Ensure scaled features maintain predictive relationships

### **IT24104124 - Feature Engineering**
**Responsibilities:**
- Create new meaningful features from existing data
- Transform existing features for better predictive power
- Handle date-based features (Birthday_count, Employed_days)
- Perform feature selection to identify most predictive attributes

### **IT24102790 - Encoding Categorical Features**
**Responsibilities:**
- Convert categorical variables to numerical representations
- Implement appropriate encoding strategies (One-Hot, Label, Target encoding)
- Handle high-cardinality categorical features
- Manage dimensionality issues from categorical encoding

## Technical Approach

### Data Preprocessing Pipeline
1. **Missing Data Handling** → **Outlier Removal** → **Categorical Encoding** → **Feature Engineering** → **Numerical Scaling**

### Model Development Strategy
- Address class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE or class weights
- Implement multiple classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Use stratified cross-validation for model evaluation
- Focus on metrics appropriate for imbalanced data (Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC)

### Key Challenges
- **Class Imbalance**: Only 11.3% rejection rate requires special handling
- **Data Quality**: Missing values and potential data entry errors
- **Feature Diversity**: Mixed data types requiring different preprocessing approaches
- **Interpretability**: Need for model explanations in financial decision-making

## Expected Outcomes
- A robust predictive model with high accuracy on minority class (rejections)
- Feature importance analysis for credit decision insights
- Deployment-ready model for credit assessment automation
- Comprehensive documentation of data preprocessing pipeline

## Project Significance
This AI solution will help financial institutions:
- Reduce manual processing time for credit applications
- Maintain consistent approval criteria
- Identify potential default risks early
- Improve customer experience through faster decisions
